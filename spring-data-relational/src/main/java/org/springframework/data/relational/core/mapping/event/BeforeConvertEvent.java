/**
 * Gets published before an aggregate gets converted into a database change, but after the decision was made if an
 * insert or an update is to be performed.
 * <p>
 * The persisting process works as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A decision is made, if the aggregate is new and therefore should be inserted or if it is not new and therefore
 * should be updated.</li>
 * <li>{@link BeforeConvertCallback} and {@link BeforeConvertEvent} get published.</li>
 * <li>An {@link org.springframework.data.relational.core.conversion.AggregateChange} object is created for the
 * aggregate. It includes the {@link org.springframework.data.relational.core.conversion.DbAction} instances to be
 * executed. This means that all the deletes, updates and inserts to be performed are determined. These actions
 * reference entities of the aggregates in order to access values to be used in the SQL statements. This step also
 * determines if the id of an entity gets passed to the database or if the database is expected to generate that id.</li>
 * <li>{@link BeforeSaveCallback} and {@link BeforeSaveEvent} get published.</li>
 * <li>SQL statements get applied to the database.</li>
 * <li>{@link AfterSaveCallback} and {@link AfterSaveEvent} get published.</li>
