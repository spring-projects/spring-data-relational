= Preface

The Spring Data JDBC project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions that use JDBC databases aligned with <<jdbc.domain-driven-design,Domain-driven design principles>>.
We provide a "`template`" as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying aggregates.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data JDBC Support.
It explains the concepts and semantics and syntax..

This section provides some basic introduction.
The rest of the document refers only to Spring Data JDBC features and assumes the user is familiar with SQL and Spring concepts.

[[get-started:first-steps:spring]]
== Learning Spring

Spring Data uses Spring framework's {spring-framework-docs}/core.html[core] functionality, including:

* {spring-framework-docs}/core.html#beans[IoC] container
* {spring-framework-docs}/core.html#validation[type conversion system]
* {spring-framework-docs}/core.html#expressions[expression language]
* {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#jmx[JMX integration]
* {spring-framework-docs}/data-access.html#dao-exceptions[DAO exception hierarchy].

While you need not know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is important.
At a minimum, the idea behind Inversion of Control (IoC) should be familiar, and you should be familiar with whatever IoC container you choose to use.

The core functionality of the JDBC Aggregate support can be used directly, with no need to invoke the IoC services of the Spring Container.
This is much like `JdbcTemplate`, which can be used "'standalone'" without any other services of the Spring container.
To leverage all the features of Spring Data JDBC, such as the repository support, you need to configure some parts of the library to use Spring.

To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive documentation that explains the Spring Framework in detail.
There are a lot of articles, blog entries, and books on the subject.
See the Spring framework https://spring.io/docs[home page] for more information.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

The Spring Data JDBC binaries require JDK level 8.0 and above and https://spring.io/docs[Spring Framework] {springVersion} and above.

In terms of databases, Spring Data JDBC requires a <<jdbc.dialects,dialect>> to abstract common SQL functionality over vendor-specific flavours.
Spring Data JDBC includes direct support for the following databases:

* DB2
* H2
* HSQLDB
* MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Postgres

If you use a different database then your application wonâ€™t startup. The <<jdbc.dialects,dialect>> section contains further detail on how to proceed in such case.
