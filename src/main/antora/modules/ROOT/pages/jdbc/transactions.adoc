[[jdbc.transactions]]
= Transactionality

The methods of `CrudRepository` instances are transactional by default.
For reading operations, the transaction configuration `readOnly` flag is set to `true`.
All others are configured with a plain `@Transactional` annotation so that default transaction configuration applies.
For details, see the Javadoc of link:{spring-data-jdbc-javadoc}org/springframework/data/jdbc/repository/support/SimpleJdbcRepository.html[`SimpleJdbcRepository`].
If you need to tweak transaction configuration for one of the methods declared in a repository, redeclare the method in your repository interface, as follows:

.Custom transaction configuration for CRUD
[source,java]
----
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  @Override
  @Transactional(timeout = 10)
  List<User> findAll();

  // Further query method declarations
}
----

The preceding causes the `findAll()` method to be run with a timeout of 10 seconds and without the `readOnly` flag.

Another way to alter transactional behavior is by using a facade or service implementation that typically covers more than one repository.
Its purpose is to define transactional boundaries for non-CRUD operations.
The following example shows how to create such a facade:

.Using a facade to define transactions for multiple repository calls
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class UserManagementImpl implements UserManagement {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;
  private final RoleRepository roleRepository;

  UserManagementImpl(UserRepository userRepository,
    RoleRepository roleRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
    this.roleRepository = roleRepository;
  }

  @Transactional
  public void addRoleToAllUsers(String roleName) {

    Role role = roleRepository.findByName(roleName);

    for (User user : userRepository.findAll()) {
      user.addRole(role);
      userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
----

The preceding example causes calls to `addRoleToAllUsers(â€¦)` to run inside a transaction (participating in an existing one or creating a new one if none are already running).
The transaction configuration for the repositories is neglected, as the outer transaction configuration determines the actual repository to be used.
Note that you have to explicitly activate `<tx:annotation-driven />` or use `@EnableTransactionManagement` to get annotation-based configuration for facades working.
Note that the preceding example assumes you use component scanning.

[[jdbc.transaction.query-methods]]
== Transactional Query Methods

To let your query methods be transactional, use `@Transactional` at the repository interface you define, as the following example shows:

.Using @Transactional at query methods
[source,java]
----
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from User u where u.active = false")
  void deleteInactiveUsers();
}
----

Typically, you want the `readOnly` flag to be set to true, because most of the query methods only read data.
In contrast to that, `deleteInactiveUsers()` uses the `@Modifying` annotation and overrides the transaction configuration.
Thus, the method is with the `readOnly` flag set to `false`.

NOTE: It is highly recommended to make query methods transactional.
These methods might execute more than one query in order to populate an entity.
Without a common transaction Spring Data JDBC executes the queries in different connections.
This may put excessive strain on the connection pool and might even lead to dead locks when multiple methods request a fresh connection while holding on to one.

NOTE: It is definitely reasonable to mark read-only queries as such by setting the `readOnly` flag.
This does not, however, act as a check that you do not trigger a manipulating query (although some databases reject `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements inside a read-only transaction).
Instead, the `readOnly` flag is propagated as a hint to the underlying JDBC driver for performance optimizations.

[[jdbc.locking]]
== JDBC Locking

Spring Data JDBC supports locking on derived query methods.
To enable locking on a given derived query method inside a repository, you annotate it with `@Lock`.
The required value of type `LockMode` offers two values: `PESSIMISTIC_READ` which guarantees that the data you are reading doesn't get modified, and `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` which obtains a lock to modify the data.
Some databases do not make this distinction.
In that cases both modes are equivalent of `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`.

.Using @Lock on derived query method
[source,java]
----
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  @Lock(LockMode.PESSIMISTIC_READ)
  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);
}
----

As you can see above, the method `findByLastname(String lastname)` will be executed with a pessimistic read lock.
If you are using a databse with the MySQL Dialect this will result for example in the following query:

.Resulting Sql query for MySQL dialect
[source,sql]
----
Select * from user u where u.lastname = lastname LOCK IN SHARE MODE
