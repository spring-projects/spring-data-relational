= Auditing

Since Spring Data R2DBC 1.2, auditing can be enabled by annotating a configuration class with the `@EnableR2dbcAuditing` annotation, as the following example shows:

.Activating auditing using JavaConfig
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableR2dbcAuditing
class Config {

    @Bean
    public ReactiveAuditorAware<AuditableUser> myAuditorProvider() {
        return new AuditorAwareImpl();
    }
}
----

If you expose a bean of type `ReactiveAuditorAware` to the `ApplicationContext`, the auditing infrastructure picks it up automatically and uses it to determine the current user to be set on domain types.
If you have multiple implementations registered in the `ApplicationContext`, you can select the one to be used by explicitly setting the `auditorAwareRef` attribute of `@EnableR2dbcAuditing`.
