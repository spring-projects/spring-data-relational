= Spring Data R2DBC

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. *Spring Data R2DBC* offers the popular Repository abstraction based on https://r2dbc.io[R2DBC].

R2DBC is the abbreviation for https://github.com/r2dbc/[Reactive Relational Database Connectivity], an incubator to integrate relational databases using a reactive driver.

The state of R2DBC is incubating to evaluate how an reactive integration could look like. To get started, you need a R2DBC driver first.

== This is NOT an ORM

Spring Data R2DBC does not try to be an ORM.
Instead it is more of a construction kit for your personal reactive relational data access component that you can define the way you like or need it.

== Maven Coordinates

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

== DatabaseClient

All functionality is encapsulated in `DatabaseClient` which is the entry point for applications that wish to integrate with relational databases using reactive drivers:

[source,java]
----
PostgresqlConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new PostgresqlConnectionFactory(PostgresqlConnectionConfiguration.builder()
		.host(…)
		.database(…)
		.username(…)
		.password(…).build());

DatabaseClient databaseClient = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);
----

The client API provides covers the following features:

* Execution of generic SQL and consumption of update count/row results.
* Generic `SELECT` with paging and ordering.
* `SELECT` of mapped objects with paging and ordering.
* Generic `INSERT` with parameter binding.
* `INSERT` of mapped objects.
* Parameter binding using the native syntax.
* Result consumption: Update count, unmapped (`Map<String, Object>`), mapped to entities, extraction function.
* Reactive repositories using `@Query` annotated methods.
* Transaction Management.

=== Examples executing generic SQL statements

[source,java]
----
Mono<Integer> count = databaseClient.execute()
				.sql("INSERT INTO legoset (id, name, manual) VALUES($1, $2, $3)")
				.bind("$1", 42055)
				.bind("$2", "Description")
				.bindNull("$3", Integer.class)
				.fetch()
				.rowsUpdated();

Flux<Map<String, Object>> rows = databaseClient.execute()
				.sql("SELECT id, name, manual FROM legoset")
				.fetch()
				.all();

Flux<Long> result = db.execute()
				.sql("SELECT txid_current();")
				.map((r, md) -> r.get(0, Long.class))
				.all();
----

=== Examples selecting data

[source,java]
----

Flux<Map<String, Object>> rows = databaseClient.select()
				.from("legoset")
				.orderBy(Sort.by(desc("id")))
				.fetch()
				.all();

Flux<LegoSet> rows = databaseClient.select()
				.from("legoset")
				.orderBy(Sort.by(desc("id")))
				.as(LegoSet.class)
				.fetch()
				.all();
----

=== Examples inserting data

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> ids = databaseClient.insert()
				.into("legoset")
				.value("id", 42055)
				.value("name", "Description")
				.nullValue("manual", Integer.class)
				.map((r, m) -> r.get("id", Integer.class)
				.all();

Mono<Void> completion = databaseClient.insert()
				.into(LegoSet.class)
				.using(legoSet)
				.then();
----

=== Examples using reactive repositories

[source,java]
----
interface LegoSetRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<LegoSet, Integer> {

		@Query("SELECT * FROM legoset WHERE name like $1")
		Flux<LegoSet> findByNameContains(String name);

		@Query("SELECT * FROM legoset WHERE manual = $1")
		Mono<LegoSet> findByManual(int manual);
}
----

=== Examples using transaction control

All examples above run with auto-committed transactions. To get group multiple statements within the same transaction or
control the transaction yourself, you need to use `TransactionalDatabaseClient`:

[source,java]
----
TransactionalDatabaseClient databaseClient = TransactionalDatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);
----

`TransactionalDatabaseClient` allows multiple flavors of transaction management:

* Participate in ongoing transactions and fall-back to auto-commit mode if there's no active transaction (default).
* Group multiple statements in a managed transaction using `TransactionalDatabaseClient.inTransaction(…)`.
* Application-controlled transaction management using `TransactionalDatabaseClient.beginTransaction()`/`commitTransaction()`/`rollbackTransaction()`.

Participating in ongoing transactions does not require changes to your application code. Instead, a managed transaction must be hosted by your application container. Transaction control needs to happen there, as well.

**Statement grouping**

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> rowsUpdated = databaseClient.inTransaction(db -> {

	return db.execute().sql("INSERT INTO legoset (id, name, manual) VALUES($1, $2, $3)") //
			.bind(0, 42055) //
			.bind(1, "Description") //
			.bindNull("$3", Integer.class) //
			.fetch()
			.rowsUpdated();
});
----

**Application-controlled transaction management**

[source,java]
----
Flux<Long> txId = databaseClient.execute().sql("SELECT txid_current();").exchange()
				.flatMapMany(it -> it.map((r, md) -> r.get(0, Long.class)).all());

Mono<Void> then = databaseClient.enableTransactionSynchronization(databaseClient.beginTransaction() //
				.thenMany(txId)) //
				.then(databaseClient.rollbackTransaction()));
----

NOTE: Application-controlled transactions must be enabled with `enableTransactionSynchronization(…)`.

== Building from Source

You don't need to build from source to use Spring Data R2DBC (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data R2DBC can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper]. You also need JDK 1.8.

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please fill out the https://cla.pivotal.io/[Contributor's Agreement] before your first change._

== Running CI tasks locally

Since this pipeline is purely Docker-based, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your `test.sh` script before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what the CI server does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-data-r2dbc-github  -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-data-r2dbc-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-data-r2dbc-github`
+
Next, test everything from inside the container:
+
3. `./mvnw -Pci,all-dbs clean dependency:list test -Dsort -B` (or whatever test configuration you must use)

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
